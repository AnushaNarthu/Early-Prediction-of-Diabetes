# Early-Prediction-of-Diabetes
#This is a group project of 1st semester- Statistical Data Mining.
#This project leverages the power of Machine Learning Algorithms, to classify data, collected from 
patients, based on the varied symptoms they developed, and tries to predict whether an individual has 
the potential to develop the disorder. The data set deals with 520 patient records, with a total of 16 
features each, the features representing the symptoms each record showed. Our objective is to take into 
account these 16 features, train a classification algorithm, which tries to learn, whether or not the 
individual has the disease, and eventually, we deploy the trained algorithm on unforeseen data, and 
evaluate how well it could do the predictions and also, we aim to realize which are the most significant 
symptoms, that could potentially contribute maximum to the development of this disorder. This entire 
exercise is achieved in multiple steps, starting from curating the dataset, data cleaning and necessary 
manipulations, selection of machine learning models based on the data set, training the models, 
validation and evaluation of the model performances and finally comparing the models to perceive the 
best fit model which can describe our objective to the maximum possible extent.
